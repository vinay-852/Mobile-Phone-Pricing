# Mobile-Phone-Pricing

## Project Overview
Mobile-Phone-Pricing is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the price range of mobile phones based on their features. It leverages classification algorithms to categorize phones into predefined price ranges, helping users or businesses make informed decisions.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Insights into the dataset, including feature distributions and correlations.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict price ranges.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for future predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Battery power
- RAM
- Screen resolution
- Processor speed
- Connectivity options (e.g., 3G, 4G, WiFi)

The target variable is the `price_range`, which categorizes phones into different price segments.

## Usage
1. **Training**: Train models using the provided dataset.
2. **Prediction**: Use trained models to predict the price range of new data.
3. **Visualization**: Explore data and model performance through visualizations.

## Applications
- Assisting consumers in selecting phones within their budget.
- Helping manufacturers analyze market trends and optimize product pricing.
